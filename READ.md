# Summary 

After blogging about my experience attending a bootcamp, a number of people were
interested in seeing the week to week breakdown of the material. The skills 
assessments in this repo are organized by week. Some weeks we had two assessments,
other weeks only one assessment. Hope it helps code newbies!
